# üõ†Ô∏è DX Automation Fixers

## Available Fix Scripts

- `fix:missing-env` ‚Äî Verifies `.env` against `required-env.json`, prints missing. Report: `tmp/reports/fix-missing-env.json`
- `fix:imports` ‚Äî Organizes and dedupes imports in all code files. Report: `tmp/reports/fix-imports.json`
- `fix:dead-code` ‚Äî Reports unused exports/files using `ts-prune`. Report: `tmp/reports/fix-dead-code.json`
- `fix:routes` ‚Äî Checks API/file co-location and missing handlers. Report: `tmp/reports/fix-routes.json`

## Usage

Run any fixer with:

```sh
npm run fix:missing-env
npm run fix:imports
npm run fix:dead-code
npm run fix:routes
```

Each fixer writes a report under `tmp/reports` with file paths and suggested patches.
# üåü Everhood - AI Vibe Hub for Gen-Z


### Quick Start Runbook
- Clone repo, install dependencies, set up .env
- Run `npx prisma migrate dev` and `npx prisma db seed`
- Start app: `npm run dev`
- Start worker: `cd worker && node index.js`
- Visit http://localhost:3000 and verify dashboard, billing usage graph, and agent jobs

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (macOS only)
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/)

### 1. Install Postgres & Redis (macOS example)
```sh
brew install postgresql
brew services start postgresql
brew install redis
brew services start redis
```

### 2. Clone the repo & install dependencies
```sh
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd everesthood
npm install
```

### 3. Setup environment variables
```sh
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in all required secrets in .env
```

### 4. Setup database
```sh
npx prisma migrate dev
npx prisma db seed
```

### 5. Start the app
```sh
npm run dev
```

### 6. Worker Service (Required for LLM/AI Jobs)
- The worker in `worker/index.js` now processes real agent jobs using BullMQ and Prisma.
- It dynamically loads agent modules from `src/agents/`, merges credentials, and updates job status in the database.
- To run the worker, open a new terminal and run:
  ```sh
  cd worker
  npm install bullmq ioredis prisma @prisma/client pino
  node index.js
  ```
- If you do not run the worker, LLM jobs (AI code generation, summaries, etc.) will not work locally.
- See the "Advanced Agent Infrastructure" and "Monitoring" sections below for more details.

### Troubleshooting
- If you see errors about Redis or Postgres, make sure both are running.
- If you see errors about the worker, see above.
- For more help, see [Redis Quickstart](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/) and [Postgres Quickstart](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

**Built with üíú for Gen-Z by Gen-Z**

## üèÅ Feature Flags (Runtime Toggles)

The platform supports runtime feature flags via the `FeatureFlag` table in the database. This allows you to toggle features (like Redis bypass) without redeploying or changing environment variables.

### Bypass Redis with Feature Flag
- The `bypass_redis` flag controls whether Redis/BullMQ is bypassed (mocked) or used for real.
- All Redis logic checks this flag at runtime (with a fallback to the `BYPASS_REDIS` env variable for safety).
- You can toggle this flag at any time:

**Bypass Redis (default):**
```sql
UPDATE "FeatureFlag" SET value = true WHERE key = 'bypass_redis';
```

**Enable Redis:**
```sql
UPDATE "FeatureFlag" SET value = false WHERE key = 'bypass_redis';
```

- This can be done via any Postgres client or Prisma Studio.
- The flag is cached in-memory for 10 seconds for performance.

### How It Works
- The codebase uses a utility (`lib/featureFlags.ts`) to fetch and cache feature flags.
- All Redis/BullMQ/cache logic uses `isRedisBypassed()` to check the flag before connecting or running jobs.
- This enables safe local development and easy future enablement of Redis.

---

## ü§ñ Advanced Agent Infrastructure

- **Dynamic Agent Registry:** Add new agents by creating files in `src/agents/` (see `exampleAgent.ts`, `enterpriseDataAnalyst.ts`).
- **Credential Handling:** AgentTemplate defines required credentials; users provide them when creating AgentInstances. Credentials are merged (instance ‚Üí template ‚Üí env) and used securely by the worker.
- **Job API:** The API at `app/api/v1/agents/run/route.ts` authenticates, creates an AgentRun, and enqueues a job.
- **Worker:** `worker/index.js` loads the correct agent, merges credentials, runs the job, and updates status/output.
- **Scheduler:** `src/scheduler/index.ts` runs scheduled jobs using cron and Redlock (see below).

---

## üß† Agent Infrastructure & Execution

- **Unified Queue:** All agent runs (manual or scheduled) are enqueued to a Redis-backed BullMQ queue.
- **Worker:** The worker (`worker/index.js`) processes jobs by dynamically loading agent modules from `src/agents/`, merging credentials, and updating job status in the database.
- **Scheduler:** The scheduler (`src/scheduler/index.ts`) runs every minute (cron), enqueues due agent jobs, and uses Redlock for distributed locking.
- **BullMQ Dashboard:** A Bull-Board dashboard is available at `/admin/queues` (see `bull-board-server.js`). It is protected by JWT authentication and supports per-user job filtering.
- **Credentials:** Agent credentials are captured via UI (if required by the template), stored encrypted in `AgentInstance.configOverride.credentials`, and never echoed back to the client.
- **Testing:** Run `npm test` for unit/integration tests. See `src/tests/agents/` and `src/tests/integration/`.

---

## ‚è∞ Running the Agent Scheduler

The scheduler runs agent jobs on a schedule (every minute by default).

```bash
node src/scheduler/index.ts
```
- Uses cron and Redlock for reliability.
- Only one instance will enqueue jobs at a time.

---

## üìä Bull-Board Dashboard (Job Monitoring)

To monitor agent jobs:

```bash
node bull-board-server.js
```

Visit [http://localhost:3009/admin/queues](http://localhost:3009/admin/queues)

- **User authentication required:**
  - Set `JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret` in your `.env`.
  - When accessing the dashboard, include the header:
    - `Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>`
  - Only jobs belonging to the authenticated user (by userId in the JWT) will be shown.
  - If the token is missing or invalid, access is denied.
- The dashboard uses the centralized BullMQ queue from `lib/queue.js`.
- All job filtering and authentication is handled server-side.

---

## Bull Board Dashboard (Admin Queues)

### How to Access
- Visit `/admin/queues` (must be logged in as admin)
- You will see Bull Board with queues: `agent:run`, `agent:webhook`, `agent:cron`
- Non-admins see read-only dashboard; admins can retry, pause, clean jobs

### Validation Steps
1. Log in as admin
2. Go to `/admin/queues`
3. Confirm all queues are listed
4. Trigger a test job (see scripts/queue-smoke.ts)
5. See job appear in Bull Board
6. Retry, pause, or clean jobs as admin
7. For stuck jobs, use `/api/queue/debug` endpoint

### Screenshot Instructions
- Take a screenshot of `/admin/queues` showing all queues and job stats
- For validation, include job details and admin controls
